# [Feature] Advanced Fizzy Exploration

**Branch:** `feature/advanced-fizzy-exploration`
**Started:** `2025-12-21`
**Status:**

- [x] In Progress
- [ ] Discard (workspace and branch abandoned)
- [ ] Complete (ready to merge)

## Purpose

Explore possibilities to create an advanced version of Fizzy by leveraging and extending the existing infrastructure: tags, comments, steps, and columns. This workspace will investigate how these building blocks can be combined or enhanced to support more sophisticated workflows, project management patterns, or collaboration features.

## Discoveries

- When renaming files. Use the mv command with relative file paths. don't cd to the directory first.
