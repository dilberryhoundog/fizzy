description: Convert components from the web to CSS sematic classes

Using the method in `app/assets/tailwind/components/CLAUDE.md`.

Work through the following folder `/docs/ui_support/rails_blocks/imported/$ARGUMENTS`

Convert these components into reusable semantic CSS classes in `app/assets/tailwind/components/$ARGUMENTS.css`

Preferrably extract the classes directly using the `@apply` directive, If needed vanilla CSS can be added to the classes for customisations better suited to direct CSS.
